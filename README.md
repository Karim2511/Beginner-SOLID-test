# Beginner-SOLID-test
üõ†Ô∏è Explanation of Changes
In the original code, the SmartHomeManager class was responsible for multiple unrelated tasks ‚Äî such as controlling devices, sending alerts, logging to the database, and interacting with external systems. This made the class hard to maintain, test, and extend.

To improve this:

I separated out responsibilities into individual components like IAlertService, IDatabase, and IExternalNotifier.

These components are now injected into SmartHomeManager, making the class focused only on managing smart devices.

I replaced direct instantiations (new EmailSender(), new SqlDatabase()) with abstractions, which makes it easier to swap implementations or mock them in tests.

The alert logic (choosing between SMS and Email) is now encapsulated in a single service, reducing the decision-making from the core logic.

These changes keep the external behavior exactly the same but make the code much easier to work with and evolve.

üìå Summary
This refactoring makes the system easier to change and test by organizing the code around clear responsibilities and reducing unnecessary dependencies between components.
It also improves flexibility ‚Äî new behavior can now be added without modifying the core logic. The code is cleaner, more focused, and better prepared for future growth.
